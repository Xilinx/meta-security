Subject: unit_tests: increment test-timeout from 40secs to 5mins

I see now and then that tests on the slower archs (arm*, mips) fail due to
the timeout restriction. Often a second build even on the same buildd
succeeds. I think that the buildd is either close to the limit or has
something else (another sbuild running) going so it does not finish the
test in 40secs.
Therefore I raise the bar to a 5 minutes limit. The worst thing that can
happen is, that it takes more than 4 minutes before an enless loop will
be detected.
