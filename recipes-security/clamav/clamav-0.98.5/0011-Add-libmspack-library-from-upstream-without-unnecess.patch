+		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2.1, February 1999
+
+ Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
+ the version number 2.1.]
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
+these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
+introduced by others.
+
+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
+libraries into non-free programs.
+
+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
+the library.
+
+  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
+special circumstances.
+
+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
+
+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
+system.
+
+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
+that program using a modified version of the Library.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
+be combined with the library in order to run.
+
+		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
+this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
+Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+
+  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+  
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
+
+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+
+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+
+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
+ordinary General Public License).
+
+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
+"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
+    Lesser General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

+
+2013-05-17  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* mspack.h: Support for decompressing a new file format, the Exchange
+	Offline Address Book (OAB). Thanks to David Woodhouse for writing
+	the implementation. I've bumped the version to 0.4alpha in celebration.
+
+2012-04-15  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* chmd_read_headers(): More thorough validation of CHM header values.
+	Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich for finding sample files.
+
+	* read_reset_table(): Better test for overflow. Thanks again to
+	Sergei Trofimovich for generating a good example.
+
+	* test/chminfo.c: this test program reads the reset table by itself
+	and was also susceptible to the same overflow problems.
+
+2012-03-16  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: make the GCC warning flags conditional
+	on using the GCC compiler. Thanks to Dagobert Michelsen for letting
+	me know.
+
+2011-11-25  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* lzxd_decompress(): Prevent matches that go beyond the start
+	of the LZX stream. Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich for testing
+	with valgrind and finding a corrupt sample file that exercises
+	this scenario.
+
+2011-11-23  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* chmd_fast_find(): add a simple check against infinite PGML
+	loops. Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich for finding sample files.
+	Multi-step PGML or PGMI infinite loops remain possible.
+
+2011-06-17  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* read_reset_table(): wasn't reading the right offset for getting
+	the LZX uncompressed length. Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich for
+	finding the bug.
+
+2011-05-31  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* kwajd.c, mszipd.c: KWAJ type 4 files (MSZIP) are now supported.
+	Thanks to Clive Turvey for sending me the format details.
+
+	* doc/szdd_kwaj_format.html: Updated documentation to cover
+	KWAJ's MSZIP compression.
+
+2011-05-11  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* cabd_find(): rethought how large vs small file support is
+	handled, as users were getting "library not compiled to support
+	large files" message on some small files. Now checks for actual
+	off_t overflow, rather than trying to preempt it.
+
+2011-05-10:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* chmd.c: implemented fast_find()
+
+	* test/chmx.c: removed the multiple extraction orders, now it just
+	extracts in the fastest order
+
+	* test/chmd_order.c: new program added to test that different
+	extraction orders don't affect the results of extraction
+
+	* test/chmd_find.c: new program to test that fast_find() works.
+	Either supply your own filename to find, or it will try finding
+	every file in the CHM.
+
+	* configure.ac: because CHM fast find requires case-insensitive
+	comparisons, tolower() or towlower() are used where possible.
+	These functions and their headers are checked for.
+
+	* mspack.h: exposed struct mschmd_sec_mscompressed's spaninfo
+	and struct mschmd_header's first_pmgl, last_pmgl and chunk_cache
+	to the world. Check that the CHM decoder version is v2 or higher
+	before using them.
+
+	* system.c: set CHM decoder version to v2
+
+2011-04-27:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* many files: Made C++ compilers much happier with libmspack.
+	Changed char * to const char * where possible.
+
+	* mspack.h: Changed user-supplied char * to const char *.
+	Unless you've written your own mspack_system implementation,
+	you will likely be unaffected.
+	If you have written your own mspack_system implementation:
+	1: change open()    so it takes a const char *filename
+	2: change message() so it takes a const char *format
+	If you cast your function into the mspack_system struct,
+	you can change the cast instead of the function.
+
+2011-04-27:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* Makefile.am: changed CFLAGS from "-Wsign-compare -Wconversion
+	-pedantic" to "-W -Wno-unused". This enables more warnings, and
+	disables these specific warnings which are now a hinderance.
+
+2011-04-27:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/cabrip.c, test/chminfo.c: used macros from system.h for
+	printing offsets and reading 64-bit values, rather than
+	reinvent the wheel.
+
+	* cabd_can_merge_folders(): declare variables at the start of
+	a block so older C compilers won't choke.
+
+	* cabd_find(): avoid compiler complaints about non-initialised
+	variables. We know they'll get initialised before use, but the
+	compiler can't reverse a state machine to draw the same conclusion.
+
+2011-04-26:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* configure.ac, mspack/system.h: Added a configure test to get
+	the size of off_t. If off_t is 8 bytes or more, we presume this
+	system has large file support. This fixes LFS detection for Fedora
+	x86_64 and Darwin/Mac OS X, neither of which declare FILESIZEBITS in
+	<limits.h>. It's not against the POSIX standard to do this: "A
+	definition of [FILESIZEBITS] shall be omitted from the <limits.h>
+	header on specific implementations where the corresponding value is
+	equal to or greater than the stated minimum, but where the value can
+	vary depending on the file to which it is applied."
+	(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/limits.h.html)
+	Thanks to Edward Sheldrake for the patch.
+
+2011-04-26:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* chmd.c: all 64-bit integer reads are now consolidated into
+	the read_off64() function
+
+	* chmd_read_headers(): this function has been made resilient
+	against accessing memory past the end of a chunk. Thanks to
+	Sergei Trofimovich for sending me examples and analysis.
+
+	* chmd_init_decomp(): this function now reads the SpanInfo file
+	if the ResetTable file isn't available, it also checks that each
+	system file it needs is large enough before accessing it, and
+	some of its code has been split into several new functions:
+	find_sys_file(), read_reset_table() and read_spaninfo()
+
+2011-04-26:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* mspack.h, chmd.c: now reads the SpanInfo system file if the
+	ResetTable file isn't available. This adds a new spaninfo pointer
+	into struct mschmd_sec_mscompressed
+
+2011-04-26:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/chminfo.c: more sanity checks for corrupted CHM files where
+	entries go past the end of a PGML/PGMI chunk, thanks to
+	Sergei Trofimovich for sending me examples and analysis.
+
+2011-04-25:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* cabd_merge():  Drew D'Addesio showed me spanning cabinets which
+	don't have all the CFFILE entries they should, but otherwise have
+	all necessary data for extraction. Changed the merging folders
+	test to be less strict; if folders don't exactly match, warn which
+	files are missing, but allow merging if at least one necessary
+	file is present.
+
+2010-09-24:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* readhuff.h: Don't let build_decode_table() allow empty trees.
+	It's meant to be special case just for the LZX length tree, so
+	move that logic out to the LZX code. Thanks to Danny Kroshin for
+	discovering the bug.
+
+	* lzxd.c: Allow empty length trees, but not other trees. If
+	the length tree is empty, fail if asked to decode a length symbol.
+	Again, thanks to Danny Kroshin for discovering the bug.
+
+2010-09-20:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* Makefile.am: Set EXTRA_DIST so it doesn't include .svn
+	directories in the distribution, but does include docs.
+
+2010-09-20:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Use modern auto* practises; turn on
+	automake silent rules where possible, use "m4" directory for libtool
+	macros, use LT_INIT instead of AC_PROG_LIBTOOL and use AM_CPPFLAGS
+	instead of INCLUDES. Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich for the patch.
+
+2010-09-15:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* many files: Made the code compile with C++
+	- Renamed all 'this' variables/parameters to 'self'
+	- Added casts to all memory allocations.
+	- Added extern "C" to header files with extern declarations.
+	- Made system.c include system.h.
+	- Changed the K&R-style headers to ANSI-style headers in md5.c
+
+2010-08-04:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* many files: removed unnecessary <unistd.h> include
+
+2010-07-19:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* cabd_md5.c, chmd_md5.c: Replace writing files to disk then
+	MD5summing them, with an MD5summer built into mspack_system.
+	Much, much faster results.
+
+	* qtmd_decompress(): Robert Riebisch pointed out a Quantum
+	data integrity check that could never be tripped, because
+	frame_todo is unsigned, so it will never be decremented
+	below zero. Replaced the check with one that assumes that
+	decrementing past zero wraps frame_todo round to a number
+	more than its maximum value (QTM_FRAME_SIZE).
+
+2010-07-18:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* cabd.c: Special logic to pass cabd_sys_read() errors back
+	to cabd_extract() wasn't compatible with the decompressor
+	logic of returning the same error repeatedly once unpacking
+	fails. This meant that if decompressing failed because of
+	a read error, then the next file in the same folder would
+	come back as "no error", but the decompressed wouldn't have
+	even attempted to decompress the file. Added a new state
+	variable, read_error, with the same lifespan as a decompressor,
+	to pass the underlying reason for MSPACK_ERR_READ errors back.
+
+	* mszipd.c: improve MS-ZIP recovery by saving all the bytes
+	decoded prior to a block failing. This requires remembering
+	how far we got through the block, so the code has been made
+	slightly slower (about 0.003 seconds slower per gigabyte
+	unpacked) by removing the local variable window_posn
+	and keeping it in the state structure instead.
+
+2010-07-16:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* Makefile.am: strange interactions. When -std=c99 is used,
+	my Ubuntu's <stdio.h> (libc6-dev 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.2) does NOT
+	define fseeko() unless _LARGEFILE_SOURCE is also defined. But
+	configure always uses -std=gnu99, not -std=c99, so its test
+	determines _LARGEFILE_SOURCE isn't needed but HAVE_FSEEKO is
+	true. The implicit fseeko definition has a 32-bit rather than
+	64-bit offset, which means the mode parameter is interpreted
+	as part of the offset, and the mode is taken from the stack,
+	which is generally 0 (SEEK_SET). This breaks all SEEK_CURs.
+	The code works fine when -std=c99 is not set, so just remove
+	it for the time being.
+
+2010-07-12:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* system.c: Reject reading/writing a negative number of bytes.
+
+	* chmd.c: allow zero-length files to be seen. Previously they were
+	skipped because they were mistaken for directory entries.
+
+2010-07-08:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* qtmd.c: Larry Frieson found an important bug in the Quantum
+	decoder. Window wraps flush all unwritten data to disk.
+	However, sometimes less data is needed, which makes
+	out_bytes negative, which is then passed to write(). Some
+	write() implementations treat negative sizes it as a large
+	positive integer and segfault trying to write the buffer.
+
+	* Makefile.am, test/*.c: fixed automake file so that the
+	package passes a "make distcheck".
+
+2010-07-07:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* doc/szdd_kwaj_format.html: explain SZDD/KWAJ file format.
+
+	* lzssd.c: fixed SZDD decompression bugs.
+
+	* test/chmd_compare: Add scripts for comparing chmd_md5 against
+	Microsoft's own code.
+
+	* test/chmd_md5.c: remove the need to decompress everything
+	twice, as this is already in chmx.c if needed.
+
+2010-07-06:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* many files: added SZDD and KWAJ decompression support.
+
+2010-06-18:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* system.h: expanded the test for 64-bit largefile support so
+	it also works on 64-bit native operating systems where you
+	don't have to define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS.
+
+2010-06-17:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* libmspack.pc.in: Added pkg-config support. Thanks to
+	Patrice Dumas for the patch.
+
+2010-06-14:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* qtmd.c, lzxd.c, mszipd.c: created new headers, readbits.h and
+	readhuff.h, which bundle up the bit-reading and huffman-reading
+	code found in the MSZIP, LZX and Quantum decoders.
+
+2010-06-11:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* qtmd_static_init(): Removed function in favour of static const
+	tables, same rationale as for lzxd_static_init().
+
+	* qtmd_read_input(), zipd_read_input(): After testing against my
+	set of CABs from the wild, I've found both these functions _need_
+	an extra EOF flag, like lzxd_read_input() has. So I've added
+	it. This means CABs get decoded properly AND there's no reading
+	fictional bytes.
+
+2010-06-03:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/cabd_md5.c: updated this so it has better output and
+	doesn't need to be in the same directory as the files for multi-
+	part sets.
+
+2010-05-20:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* qtmd_read_input(), zipd_read_input(): Both these functions are
+	essentially copies of lzxd_read_input(), but that has a feature
+	they don't have - an extra EOF flag. So if EOF is
+	encountered (sys->read() returns 0 bytes), these don't pass on the
+	error. Their respective bit-reading functions that called them
+	then go on to access at least one byte of the input buffer, which
+	doesn't exist as sys->read() returned 0. Thanks to Michael
+	Vidrevich for spotting this and providing a test case.
+
+2010-05-20:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* system.h: It turns out no configure.ac tests are needed to
+	decide between __func__ and __FUNCTION__, so I put the standard
+	one (__func__) back into the D() macro, along with some
+	special-case ifdefs for old versions of GCC.
+
+	* lzxd_static_init(): Removed function in favour of static const
+	tables.  Jorge Lodos thinks it causes multithreading problems, I
+	disagree. However, there are speed benefits to declaring the
+	tables as static const.
+
+	* cabd_init_decomp(): Fixed code which never runs but would write
+	to a null pointer if it could. Changed it to an assert() as it
+	will only trip if someone rewrites the internals of cabd.c. Thanks
+	to Jorge Lodos for finding it.
+
+	* inflate(): Fixed an off-by-one error: if the LITERAL table
+	emitted code 286, this would read one byte past the end of
+	lit_extrabits[]. Thanks to Jorge Lodos for finding it.
+
+2010-05-06:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/cabrip.c, test/chminfo.c: add fseeko() support
+
+2009-06-01:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* README: clarify the extended license terms
+
+	* doc, Makefile.am: make the doxygen makefile work when using
+	an alternate build directory
+
+2006-09-20:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* system.h: I had a choice of adding more to configure.ac to
+	test for __func__ and __FUNCTION__, or just removing __FUNCTION__
+	from the D() macro. I chose the latter.
+
+	* Makefile.am: Now the --enable-debug in configure will actually
+	apply -DDEBUG to the sources.
+
+2006-09-20:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* qtmd_decompress(): Fixed a major bug in the QTM decoder, as
+	reported by Tomasz Kojm last year. Removed the restriction on
+	window sizes as a result. Correctly decodes the XLVIEW cabinets.
+
+2006-08-31:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* lzxd_decompress(): Two major bugs fixed. Firstly, the R0/R1/R2
+	local variables weren't set to 1 after lzxd_reset_state().
+	Secondly, the LZX decompression stream can sometimes become
+	odd-aligned (after an uncompressed block) and the next 16 bit
+	fetch needs to be split across two input buffers, ENSURE_BITS()
+	didn't cover this case. Many thanks to Igor Glucksmann for
+	discovering both these bugs.
+
+2005-06-30:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* cabd_search(): fixed problems with searching files > 4GB for
+	cabinets.
+
+2005-06-23:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* qtmd_init(): The QTM decoder is broken for QTM streams with a
+	window size less than the frame size. Until this is fixed, fail
+	to initialise QTM window sizes less than 15. Thanks to Tomasz Kojm
+	for finding the bug.
+
+2005-03-22:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* system.h: now undefs "read", as the latest glibc defines read()
+	as a macro which messes everything up. Thanks to Ville Skytt for
+	the update.
+
+2005-03-14:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/multifh.c: write an mspack_system implementation that can
+	handle normal disk files, open file handles, open file descriptors
+	and raw memory all at the same time.
+
+2005-02-24:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* chmd_read_headers(): avoid infinite loop when chmhs1_ChunkSize is
+	zero. Thanks to Serge Semashko for the research and discovery.
+
+2005-02-18:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* mspack.h: renamed the "interface" parameter of mspack_version() to
+	"entity", as interface is a reserved word in C++. Thanks to Yuriy Z
+	for the discovery.
+
+2004-12-09:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* lzss.h, szdd.h, szddd.h: more work on the SZDD/LZSS design.
+	
+2004-06-12:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* lzxd_static_init(): removed write to lzxd_extra_bits[52], thanks
+	to Nigel Horne from the ClamAV project.
+
+2004-04-23:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* mspack.h: changed 'this' parameters to 'self' to allow compiling in
+	C++ compilers, thanks to Michal Cihar for the suggestion.
+
+	* mspack.h, system.h, mspack.def, winbuild.sh: integrated some changes
+	from Petr Blahos to let libmspack build as a Win32 DLL.
+
+	* chmd_fast_find(): added the first part of this code, and comments
+	sufficient to finish it :)
+
+2004-04-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/chminfo.c: added a program for dumping useful data from CHM
+	files, e.g. index entries and reset tables. I wrote this a while ago
+	for investigating a corrupt cabinet, but I never committed it.
+
+2004-03-26  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* test/cabd_memory.c: added a new test example which shows an
+	mspack_system implementation that reads and writes from memory only,
+	no file I/O. Even the source code has a little cab file embedded in it.
+
+2004-03-10  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* cabd.c: updated the location of the CAB SDK.
+
+	* cabd.c: changed a couple of MSPACK_ERR_READ errors not based on
+	read() failures into MSPACK_ERR_DATAFORMAT errors.
+
+	* mszipd_decompress(): repair mode now aborts after writing a
+	repaired block if the error was a hard error (e.g. read error, out
+	of blocks, etc)
+
+2004-03-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* Makefile.am: now builds and installs a versioned library.
+
+	* mszipd.c: completed a new MS-ZIP and inflate implementation.
+
+	* system.c: added mspack_version() and committed to a versioned
+	ABI for the library.
+
+	* cabd.c: made mszip repair functionality work correctly.
+
+	* cabd.c: now identifies invalid block headers
+
+	* doc/: API documentation is now included with the library, not
+	just on the web.
+
+	* chmd.c: fixed error messages and 64-bit debug output.
+
+	* chmd.c: now also catches NULL files in section 1.
+
+	* test/chmx.c: now acts more like cabextract.
+
+2003-08-29  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>
+
+	* ChangeLog: started keeping a ChangeLog :)

+
+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
+configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
+
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:
+
+     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
+
+   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
+may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
+using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
+`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
+They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
+is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
+`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
+package recognizes.
+
+   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
+find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
+you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
+`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
+CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   HP-UX `make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as
+their prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped
+generated files such as `configure' are involved.  Use GNU `make'
+instead.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
+a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
+to try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
+in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
+not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
+will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
+_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
+`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
+
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
+
+     OS
+     KERNEL-OS
+
+   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the machine type.
+
+   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
+use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
+produce code for.
+
+   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
+platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
+"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
+eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Defining Variables
+==================
+
+   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
+an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+`configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+`--help'
+`-h'
+     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--help=short'
+`--help=recursive'
+     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
+     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
+     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
+     also present in any nested packages.
+
+`--version'
+`-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+`--config-cache'
+`-C'
+     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`--prefix=DIR'
+     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
+     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
+     the installation locations.
+
+`--no-create'
+`-n'
+     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
+     files.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+`configure --help' for more details.

+libmspack 0.4alpha
+
+The purpose of libmspack is to provide compressors and decompressors,
+archivers and dearchivers for Microsoft compression formats: CAB, CHM, WIM,
+LIT, HLP, KWAJ and SZDD. It is also designed to be easily embeddable,
+stable, robust and resource-efficient.
+
+The library is not intended as a generalised "any archiver" interface.
+Users of the library must explicitly choose the format they intend to work
+with.
+
+All special features of the above formats will be covered as fully as
+possible -- for example, CAB's multi-part cabinet sets, or CHM's fast
+lookup indices. All compression methods used by the formats will be
+implemented as completely as possible.
+
+However, other than what is required for access to these formats and their
+features, no other functionality is intended. There is no file metadata
+translation functionality. All file I/O is abstracted, although a default
+implementation using the standard C library is provided.
+
+
+DOCUMENTATION
+
+The API documentation is stored in the doc/ directory. It is generated
+automatically from mspack.h with doxygen. It is also available online at
+http://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/doc/
+
+
+BUILDING / INSTALLING
+
+./configure
+make
+make install
+
+This will install the main libmspack library and mspack.h header file.
+Some other libraries and executables are built, but not installed.
+
+If building from the Subversion repository, running rebuild.sh will create
+all the automatically generated files like the configure script, and will
+then ./configure, make and make distcheck. Running cleanup.sh will perform
+a thorough clean, deleting all automatically generated files.
+
+In addition to gcc, you also need the following for building from Subversion:
+
+- at least autoconf 2.57
+- at least automake 1.7
+- libtool
+
+This is an alpha release. Unless you are in a position to package the
+libmspack library for the environment you intend to run your application,
+it is recommended that you do not rely on users of your software having
+the binary library installed and instead you should include the libmspack
+source files directly in your application's build environment.
+
+
+LEGAL ISSUES
+
+The the best of my knowledge, libmspack does not infringe on any
+compression or decompression patents. However, this is not legal
+advice, and it is recommended that you perform your own patent search.
+
+libmspack is licensed under the LGPL - see COPYING.LIB in this directory.
+
+The LGPL requires you to build libmspack as a stand alone library then link
+your code to it using a linker. I personally grant you some extra rights:
+you can incorporate libmspack's source code wholly or partially in your own
+code, without having to build and link libmspack as an independent library,
+provided you meet ALL of the following conditions:
+
+1. ANY modifications to the existing libmspack source code are published and
+   distributed under the LGPL license.
+2. You MUST NOT use libmspack function calls, structures or definitions unless
+   they are defined in the public library interface "mspack.h".
+3. When distributing your code, you MUST make clear your code uses libmspack,
+   and either include the full libmspack distribution with your code, or
+   provide access to it as per clause 4 of the LGPL.
+
+EXAMPLE CODE
+
+There are a number of useful programs in the test/ directory which
+exercise and demonstrate libmspack's features.
+
+cabd_c10       - Tests the CAB decompressor on the C10 collection.
+cabd_compare   - Compares the CAB decompressor with Microsoft's EXTRACT.EXE
+cabd_md5       - Prints the MD5 checksums of all files within a CAB file/set.
+cabd_memory    - An mspack_system implementation that reads/writes to memory.
+cabd_test      - Regression tests for libmspack's CAB decompression.
+cabrip         - Extracts any CAB files embedded in another file.
+chmd_compare   - Compares the CHM decompressor to Microsoft's HH.EXE
+chmd_find      - Fast-finds a file within a CHM file.
+chmd_md5       - Prints the MD5 checksums of all files within a CHM file.
+chmd_order     - Tests extracting files in a CHM file in four different ways.
+chminfo        - Prints verbose information about CHM file structures.
+chmx           - Extracts all files in a CHM file to disk.
+expand         - Extracts an SZDD or KWAJ file.
+msdecompile_md5- Runs Microsoft's HH.EXE -DECOMPILE via WINE.
+msexpand_md5   - Runs Microsoft's EXTRACT.EXE via WINE.
+multifh        - An mspack_system implementation that can simultaneously work
+                 on in-memory images, raw file descriptors, open file handles
+                 and regular disk files.
+
+Here is a simple example of usage, which will create a CAB decompressor,
+then use that to open an existing Microsoft CAB file called "example.cab",
+and list the names of all the files contained in that cab.
+
+#include <stdio.h>
+#include <unistd.h>
+#include <mspack.h>
+
+int main() {
+  struct mscab_decompressor *cabd;
+  struct mscabd_cabinet *cab;
+  struct mscabd_file *file;
+  int test;
+
+  MSPACK_SYS_SELFTEST(test);
+  if (test != MSPACK_ERR_OK) exit(0);
+
+  if ((cabd = mspack_create_cab_decompressor(NULL))) {
+    if ((cab = cabd->open(cabd, "example.cab"))) {
+      for (file = cab->files; file; file = file->next) {
+        printf("%s\n", file->filename);
+      }
+      cabd->close(cabd, cab);
+    }
+    mspack_destroy_cab_decompressor(cabd);
+  }
+  return 0;
+}

+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#

+# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a

+# One issue with vendor `install' (even GNU) is that you can't
+# specify the program used to strip binaries.  This is especially
+# annoying in cross-compiling environments, where the build's strip
+# is unlikely to handle the host's binaries.
+# Fortunately install-sh will honor a STRIPPROG variable, so we
+# always use install-sh in `make install-strip', and initialize
+# STRIPPROG with the value of the STRIP variable (set by the user).
+AC_DEFUN([AM_PROG_INSTALL_STRIP],
+[AC_REQUIRE([AM_PROG_INSTALL_SH])dnl
+# Installed binaries are usually stripped using `strip' when the user
+# run `make install-strip'.  However `strip' might not be the right
+# tool to use in cross-compilation environments, therefore Automake
+# will honor the `STRIP' environment variable to overrule this program.
+dnl Don't test for $cross_compiling = yes, because it might be `maybe'.

+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN

+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)

+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.

+ * and usually the last folder of each cabinet extends into the next

+
+/* Notes on compliance with cabinet specification:
+ *
+ * One of the main changes between cabextract 0.6 and libmspack's cab
+ * decompressor is the move from block-oriented decompression to
+ * stream-oriented decompression.
+ *
+ * cabextract would read one data block from disk, decompress it with the
+ * appropriate method, then write the decompressed data. The CAB
+ * specification is specifically designed to work like this, as it ensures
+ * compression matches do not span the maximum decompressed block size
+ * limit of 32kb.
+ *
+ * However, the compression algorithms used are stream oriented, with
+ * specific hacks added to them to enforce the "individual 32kb blocks"
+ * rule in CABs. In other file formats, they do not have this limitation.
+ *
+ * In order to make more generalised decompressors, libmspack's CAB
+ * decompressor has moved from being block-oriented to more stream
+ * oriented. This also makes decompression slightly faster.
+ *
+ * However, this leads to incompliance with the CAB specification. The
+ * CAB controller can no longer ensure each block of input given to the
+ * decompressors is matched with their output. The "decompressed size" of
+ * each individual block is thrown away.
+ *
+ * Each CAB block is supposed to be seen as individually compressed. This
+ * means each consecutive data block can have completely different
+ * "uncompressed" sizes, ranging from 1 to 32768 bytes. However, in
+ * reality, all data blocks in a folder decompress to exactly 32768 bytes,
+ * excepting the final block. 
+ *
+ * Given this situation, the decompression algorithms are designed to
+ * realign their input bitstreams on 32768 output-byte boundaries, and
+ * various other special cases have been made. libmspack will not
+ * correctly decompress LZX or Quantum compressed folders where the blocks
+ * do not follow this "32768 bytes until last block" pattern. It could be
+ * implemented if needed, but hopefully this is not necessary -- it has
+ * not been seen in over 3Gb of CAB archives.

+ *  COPYRIGHT (C) 1986 Gary S. Brown.  You may use this program, or
+ *  code or tables extracted from it, as desired without restriction.
+ *
+ *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
+ *  polynomial is
+ *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
+ *
+ *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
+ *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
+ *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
+ *  the MSB being 1
+ *
+ *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
+ *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
+ *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
+ *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
+ *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
+ *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
+ *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
+ *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
+ *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
+ *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
+ *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
+ *
+ *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
+ *
+ *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
+ *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
+ *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
+ *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
+ *
+ *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
+ *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
+ *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
+ *      using byte-swap instructions

+#include <system.h>
+#include <lzx.h>
+
+/* Microsoft's LZX document (in cab-sdk.exe) and their implementation
+ * of the com.ms.util.cab Java package do not concur.
+ *
+ * In the LZX document, there is a table showing the correlation between
+ * window size and the number of position slots. It states that the 1MB
+ * window = 40 slots and the 2MB window = 42 slots. In the implementation,
+ * 1MB = 42 slots, 2MB = 50 slots. The actual calculation is 'find the
+ * first slot whose position base is equal to or more than the required
+ * window size'. This would explain why other tables in the document refer
+ * to 50 slots rather than 42.
+ *
+ * The constant NUM_PRIMARY_LENGTHS used in the decompression pseudocode
+ * is not defined in the specification.
+ *
+ * The LZX document does not state the uncompressed block has an
+ * uncompressed length field. Where does this length field come from, so
+ * we can know how large the block is? The implementation has it as the 24
+ * bits following after the 3 blocktype bits, before the alignment
+ * padding.
+ *
+ * The LZX document states that aligned offset blocks have their aligned
+ * offset huffman tree AFTER the main and length trees. The implementation
+ * suggests that the aligned offset tree is BEFORE the main and length
+ * trees.
+ *
+ * The LZX document decoding algorithm states that, in an aligned offset
+ * block, if an extra_bits value is 1, 2 or 3, then that number of bits
+ * should be read and the result added to the match offset. This is
+ * correct for 1 and 2, but not 3, where just a huffman symbol (using the
+ * aligned tree) should be read.
+ *
+ * Regarding the E8 preprocessing, the LZX document states 'No translation
+ * may be performed on the last 6 bytes of the input block'. This is
+ * correct.  However, the pseudocode provided checks for the *E8 leader*
+ * up to the last 6 bytes. If the leader appears between -10 and -7 bytes
+ * from the end, this would cause the next four bytes to be modified, at
+ * least one of which would be in the last 6 bytes, which is not allowed
+ * according to the spec.
+ *
+ * The specification states that the huffman trees must always contain at
+ * least one element. However, many CAB files contain blocks where the
+ * length tree is completely empty (because there are no matches), and
+ * this is expected to succeed.
+ *
+ * The errors in LZX documentation appear have been corrected in the
+ * new documentation for the LZX DELTA format.
+ *
+ *     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc483133.aspx
+ *
+ * However, this is a different format, an extension of regular LZX.
+ * I have noticed the following differences, there may be more:
+ *
+ * The maximum window size has increased from 2MB to 32MB. This also
+ * increases the maximum number of position slots, etc.
+ *
+ * If the match length is 257 (the maximum possible), this signals
+ * a further length decoding step, that allows for matches up to
+ * 33024 bytes long.
+ *
+ * The format now allows for "reference data", supplied by the caller.
+ * If match offsets go further back than the number of bytes
+ * decompressed so far, that is them accessing the reference data.

+/** \mainpage
+ *
+ * \section intro Introduction
+ *
+ * libmspack is a library which provides compressors and decompressors,
+ * archivers and dearchivers for Microsoft compression formats.
+ *
+ * \section formats Formats supported
+ *
+ * The following file formats are supported:
+ * - SZDD files, which use LZSS compression
+ * - KWAJ files, which use LZSS, LZSS+Huffman or deflate compression
+ * - .HLP (MS Help) files, which use LZSS compression
+ * - .CAB (MS Cabinet) files, which use deflate, LZX or Quantum compression
+ * - .CHM (HTML Help) files, which use LZX compression
+ * - .LIT (MS EBook) files, which use LZX compression and DES encryption
+ * - .LZX (Exchange Offline Addressbook) files, which use LZX compression
+ *
+ * To determine the capabilities of the library, and the binary
+ * compatibility version of any particular compressor or decompressor, use
+ * the mspack_version() function. The UNIX library interface version is
+ * defined as the highest-versioned library component.
+ *
+ * \section starting Getting started
+ *
+ * The macro MSPACK_SYS_SELFTEST() should be used to ensure the library can
+ * be used. In particular, it checks if the caller is using 32-bit file I/O
+ * when the library is compiled for 64-bit file I/O and vice versa.
+ *
+ * If compiled normally, the library includes basic file I/O and memory
+ * management functionality using the standard C library. This can be
+ * customised and replaced entirely by creating a mspack_system structure.
+ *
+ * A compressor or decompressor for the required format must be
+ * instantiated before it can be used. Each construction function takes
+ * one parameter, which is either a pointer to a custom mspack_system
+ * structure, or NULL to use the default. The instantiation returned, if
+ * not NULL, contains function pointers (methods) to work with the given
+ * file format.
+ * 
+ * For compression:
+ * - mspack_create_cab_compressor() creates a mscab_compressor
+ * - mspack_create_chm_compressor() creates a mschm_compressor
+ * - mspack_create_lit_compressor() creates a mslit_compressor
+ * - mspack_create_hlp_compressor() creates a mshlp_compressor
+ * - mspack_create_szdd_compressor() creates a msszdd_compressor
+ * - mspack_create_kwaj_compressor() creates a mskwaj_compressor
+ * - mspack_create_oab_compressor() creates a msoab_compressor
+ *
+ * For decompression:
+ * - mspack_create_cab_decompressor() creates a mscab_decompressor
+ * - mspack_create_chm_decompressor() creates a mschm_decompressor
+ * - mspack_create_lit_decompressor() creates a mslit_decompressor
+ * - mspack_create_hlp_decompressor() creates a mshlp_decompressor
+ * - mspack_create_szdd_decompressor() creates a msszdd_decompressor
+ * - mspack_create_kwaj_decompressor() creates a mskwaj_decompressor
+ * - mspack_create_oab_decompressor() creates a msoab_decompressor
+ *
+ * Once finished working with a format, each kind of
+ * compressor/decompressor has its own specific destructor:
+ * - mspack_destroy_cab_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_cab_decompressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_chm_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_chm_decompressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_lit_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_lit_decompressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_hlp_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_hlp_decompressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_szdd_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_szdd_decompressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_kwaj_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_kwaj_decompressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_oab_compressor()
+ * - mspack_destroy_oab_decompressor()
+ *
+ * Destroying a compressor or decompressor does not destroy any objects,
+ * structures or handles that have been created using that compressor or
+ * decompressor. Ensure that everything created or opened is destroyed or
+ * closed before compressor/decompressor is itself destroyed.
+ *
+ * \section errors Error codes
+ *
+ * All compressors and decompressors use the same set of error codes. Most
+ * methods return an error code directly. For methods which do not
+ * return error codes directly, the error code can be obtained with the
+ * last_error() method.
+ *
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_OK is used to indicate success. This error code is defined
+ *   as zero, all other code are non-zero.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_ARGS indicates that a method was called with inappropriate
+ *   arguments.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_OPEN indicates that mspack_system::open() failed.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_READ indicates that mspack_system::read() failed.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_WRITE indicates that mspack_system::write() failed.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_SEEK indicates that mspack_system::seek() failed.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_NOMEMORY indicates that mspack_system::alloc() failed.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_SIGNATURE indicates that the file being read does not
+ *   have the correct "signature". It is probably not a valid file for
+ *   whatever format is being read.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_DATAFORMAT indicates that the file being used or read
+ *   is corrupt.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_CHECKSUM indicates that a data checksum has failed.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_CRUNCH indicates an error occured during compression.
+ * - #MSPACK_ERR_DECRUNCH indicates an error occured during decompression.
+ *
+ * \section threading Multi-threading
+ *
+ * libmspack methods are reentrant and multithreading-safe when each
+ * thread has its own compressor or decompressor.
+
+ * You should not call multiple methods simultaneously on a single
+ * compressor or decompressor instance.
+ *
+ * If this may happen, you can either use one compressor or
+ * decompressor per thread, or you can use your preferred lock,
+ * semaphore or mutex library to ensure no more than one method on a
+ * compressor/decompressor is called simultaneously. libmspack will
+ * not do this locking for you.
+ *
+ * Example of incorrect behaviour:
+ * - thread 1 calls mspack_create_cab_decompressor()
+ * - thread 1 calls open()
+ * - thread 1 calls extract() for one file
+ * - thread 2 simultaneously calls extract() for another file
+ *
+ * Correct behaviour:
+ * - thread 1 calls mspack_create_cab_decompressor()
+ * - thread 2 calls mspack_create_cab_decompressor()
+ * - thread 1 calls its own open() / extract()
+ * - thread 2 simultaneously calls its own open() / extract()
+ *
+ * Also correct behaviour:
+ * - thread 1 calls mspack_create_cab_decompressor()
+ * - thread 1 locks a mutex for with the decompressor before
+ *   calling any methods on it, and unlocks the mutex after each
+ *   method returns.
+ * - thread 1 can share the results of open() with thread 2, and both
+ *   can call extract(), provided they both guard against simultaneous
+ *   use of extract(), and any other methods, with the mutex

+/**
+ * A structure which abstracts file I/O and memory management.
+ *
+ * The library always uses the mspack_system structure for interaction
+ * with the file system and to allocate, free and copy all memory. It also
+ * uses it to send literal messages to the library user.
+ *
+ * When the library is compiled normally, passing NULL to a compressor or
+ * decompressor constructor will result in a default mspack_system being
+ * used, where all methods are implemented with the standard C library.
+ * However, all constructors support being given a custom created
+ * mspack_system structure, with the library user's own methods. This
+ * allows for more abstract interaction, such as reading and writing files
+ * directly to memory, or from a network socket or pipe.
+ *
+ * Implementors of an mspack_system structure should read all
+ * documentation entries for every structure member, and write methods
+ * which conform to those standards.

+   * The CHM file format includes data about the compressed section (such
+   * as its overall size) that is stored in the output CHM file prior to
+   * the compressed section itself. This unavoidably requires that the
+   * compressed section has to be generated, before these details can be
+   * set. There are several ways this can be handled. Firstly, the
+   * compressed section could be generated entirely in memory before
+   * writing any of the output CHM file. This approach is not used in
+   * libmspack, as the compressed section can exceed the addressable
+   * memory space on most architectures.
+   *
+   * libmspack has two options, either to write these unknowable sections
+   * with blank data, generate the compressed section, then re-open the
+   * output file for update once the compressed section has been
+   * completed, or to write the compressed section to a temporary file,
+   * then write the entire output file at once, performing a simple
+   * file-to-file copy for the compressed section.
+   *
+   * The simple solution of buffering the entire compressed section in
+   * memory can still be used, if desired. As the temporary file's
+   * filename is passed directly to mspack_system::open(), it is possible
+   * for a custom mspack_system implementation to hold this file in memory,
+   * without writing to a disk.
+   *
+   * If a temporary file is set, generate() performs the following
+   * sequence of events: the temporary file is opened for writing, the
+   * compression algorithm writes to the temporary file, the temporary
+   * file is closed.  Then the output file is opened for writing and the
+   * temporary file is re-opened for reading. The output file is written
+   * and the temporary file is read from. Both files are then closed. The
+   * temporary file itself is not deleted. If that is desired, the
+   * temporary file should be deleted after the completion of generate(),
+   * if it exists.
+   *
+   * If a temporary file is set not to be used, generate() performs the
+   * following sequence of events: the output file is opened for writing,
+   * then it is written and closed. The output file is then re-opened for
+   * update, the appropriate sections are seek()ed to and re-written, then

+   *   names of files in the CHM itself. Defaults to 0, any value between

+   * - #MSCHMC_PARAM_LANGUAGE: Sets the "language" of the CHM file
+   *   generated.  This is not the language used in the CHM file, but the
+   *   language setting of the user who ran the HTMLHelp compiler. It
+   *   defaults to 0x0409. The valid range is between 0x0000 and 0x7F7F.
+   * - #MSCHMC_PARAM_LZXWINDOW: Sets the size of the LZX history window,
+   *   which is also the interval at which the compressed data stream can be
+   *   randomly accessed. The value is not a size in bytes, but a power of
+   *   two. The default value is 16 (which makes the window 2^16 bytes, or
+   *   64 kilobytes), the valid range is from 15 (32 kilobytes) to 21 (2
+   *   megabytes).
+   * - #MSCHMC_PARAM_DENSITY: Sets the "density" of quick reference
+   *   entries stored at the end of directory listing chunk. Each chunk is
+   *   4096 bytes in size, and contains as many file entries as there is
+   *   room for. At the other end of the chunk, a list of "quick reference"

+   * - #MSCHMC_PARAM_INDEX: Sets whether or not to include quick lookup
+   *   index chunk(s), in addition to normal directory listing chunks. A
+   *   value of zero means no index chunks will be created, a non-zero value

+
+/* this header defines macros that read data streams by
+ * the individual bits
+ *
+ * INIT_BITS         initialises bitstream state in state structure
+ * STORE_BITS        stores bitstream state in state structure
+ * RESTORE_BITS      restores bitstream state from state structure
+ * ENSURE_BITS(n)    ensure there are at least N bits in the bit buffer
+ * READ_BITS(var,n)  takes N bits from the buffer and puts them in var
+ * PEEK_BITS(n)      extracts without removing N bits from the bit buffer
+ * REMOVE_BITS(n)    removes N bits from the bit buffer
+ *
+ * READ_BITS simply calls ENSURE_BITS, PEEK_BITS and REMOVE_BITS,
+ * which means it's limited to reading the number of bits you can
+ * ensure at any one time. It also fails if asked to read zero bits.
+ * If you need to read zero bits, or more bits than can be ensured in
+ * one go, use READ_MANY_BITS instead.
+ *
+ * These macros have variable names baked into them, so to use them
+ * you have to define some macros:
+ * - BITS_TYPE: the type name of your state structure
+ * - BITS_VAR: the variable that points to your state structure
+ * - define BITS_ORDER_MSB if bits are read from the MSB, or
+ *   define BITS_ORDER_LSB if bits are read from the LSB
+ * - READ_BYTES: some code that reads more data into the bit buffer,
+ *   it should use READ_IF_NEEDED (calls read_input if the byte buffer
+ *   is empty), then INJECT_BITS(data,n) to put data from the byte
+ *   buffer into the bit buffer.
+ *
+ * You also need to define some variables and structure members:
+ * - unsigned char *i_ptr;    // current position in the byte buffer
+ * - unsigned char *i_end;    // end of the byte buffer
+ * - unsigned int bit_buffer; // the bit buffer itself
+ * - unsigned int bits_left;  // number of bits remaining
+ *
+ * If you use read_input() and READ_IF_NEEDED, they also expect these
+ * structure members:
+ * - struct mspack_system *sys;  // to access sys->read()
+ * - unsigned int error;         // to record/return read errors
+ * - unsigned char input_end;    // to mark reaching the EOF
+ * - unsigned char *inbuf;       // the input byte buffer
+ * - unsigned int inbuf_size;    // the size of the input byte buffer
+ *
+ * Your READ_BYTES implementation should read data from *i_ptr and
+ * put them in the bit buffer. READ_IF_NEEDED will call read_input()
+ * if i_ptr reaches i_end, and will fill up inbuf and set i_ptr to
+ * the start of inbuf and i_end to the end of inbuf.
+ *
+ * If you're reading in MSB order, the routines work by using the area
+ * beyond the MSB and the LSB of the bit buffer as a free source of
+ * zeroes when shifting. This avoids having to mask any bits. So we
+ * have to know the bit width of the bit buffer variable. We use
+ * <limits.h> and CHAR_BIT to find the size of the bit buffer in bits.
+ *
+ * If you are reading in LSB order, bits need to be masked. Normally
+ * this is done by computing the mask: N bits are masked by the value
+ * (1<<N)-1). However, you can define BITS_LSB_TABLE to use a lookup
+ * table instead of computing this. This adds two new macros,
+ * PEEK_BITS_T and READ_BITS_T which work the same way as PEEK_BITS
+ * and READ_BITS, except they use this lookup table. This is useful if
+ * you need to look up a number of bits that are only known at
+ * runtime, so the bit mask can't be turned into a constant by the
+ * compiler.
+
+ * The bit buffer datatype should be at least 32 bits wide: it must be
+ * possible to ENSURE_BITS(17), so it must be possible to add 16 new bits
+ * to the bit buffer when the bit buffer already has 1 to 15 bits left.
